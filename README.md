# ü§ñ‚è∞ Plextime scripts ![GitHub CI Workflow Status](https://github.com/borjapazr/plextime-scripts/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Scripts for automatic clocking in and out on Plextime platform written in Python and scheduled using schedule (Python library) or Ofelia (Docker)

## üß© Requirements

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- Make

## üßë‚Äçüç≥ Configuration

Before deploying the service it is necessary to configure it. To do so, it is enough to create an .env file with the content of the corresponding .env.template. You can also use the `make env` command.

There are two ways to configure the service for automatic clocking. The first one is based on the scheduling of clockings from each employee's timetable (`INTERNAL_SCHEDULING` to `true`). The second one allows to set the scheduling using a service called [Ophelia](https://github.com/mcuadros/ofelia). To use it, just copy the content of the `docker-compose-ofelia.yml` file into the `docker-compose.yml` file and review its configuration to understand how it works. It is very simple. Just set the environment variables `CHECKIN_CRON_EXPRESSION`, `CHECKOUT_FULL_DAY_CRON_EXPRESSION` and `CHECKOUT_HALF_DAY_CRON_EXPRESSION` with the cron expressions that match the employee's timetable.

### Environment variables that need to be configured

- `INTERNAL_SCHEDULING`: Enables or disables the scheduling of automatic clockings based on the user's timetable. `true` or `false` (default)
- `PLEXTIME_USER`: Plextime user
- `PLEXTIME_PASSWORD`: Plextime user's password
- `PLEXTIME_JOURNAL_OPTION`: Type of clocking to be performed. For example, telework, office, client, etc. The default value is telework (`8`). To find out the different identifiers available, please fill in your username and password and run the command `make journal-options`.
- `CHECKIN_CRON_EXPRESSION`: Check-in cron expression. For example, `0 0 8 * * MON-FRI`
- `CHECKOUT_FULL_DAY_CRON_EXPRESSION`: Check-out cron expression for full working days. For example, `0 0 19 * * MON,WED`
- `CHECKOUT_HALF_DAY_CRON_EXPRESSION`: Check-out Cron expression for half working days. For example, `0 0 15 * * TUE,THU,FRI`
- `CHECKIN_RANDOM_MARGIN`: Maximum value (in seconds) for the random timeout for check-in process. For example, `900`. Default is `0`
- `CHECKOUT_RANDOM_MARGIN`: Maximum value (in seconds) for the random timeout for check-out process. For example, `1800`. Default is `0`
- `TELEGRAM_NOTIFICATIONS`: Enable or disable Telgram notifications. `true` or `false`
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Telegram bot token for notifications
- `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID`: Telegram channel to receive notifications
- `TZ`: Timezone. For example, `Europe/Madrid`
